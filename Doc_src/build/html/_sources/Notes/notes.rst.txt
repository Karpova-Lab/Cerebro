Git
===

Using Git
---------

Here is an nice introduction to what Git is: `Tutorial by Atlassian <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control>`_

If you don't want to use the command line for running Git commands, I recommend downloading `SourceTree <https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/>`_ to use as a GUI.


Cloning the Cerebro repository from Github
------------------------------------------

From the Command Line
`````````````````````

Create a new folder into which you want to clone the repository

.. code::

   mkdir mylocalrepo

Navigate into the folder you just created and then clone the contents of the Cerebro repository from Github

.. code::

   cd mylocalrepo/
   git clone https://github.com/Karpova-Lab/cerebro.git .

From a Mac terminal it will look like this:

Using SourceTree
````````````````
1. Navigate to File -> New/Clone
2. Paste ``https://github.com/Karpova-Lab/cerebro.git`` as the source/URL
3. The files now exist locally on your computer
